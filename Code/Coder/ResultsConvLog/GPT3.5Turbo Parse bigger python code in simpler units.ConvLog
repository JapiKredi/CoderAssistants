### QA Test Cases:

1. **Lexical Analysis:**
   - Verify that the code is successfully tokenized by checking the output tokens.
   - Test with different input codes containing keywords, identifiers, operators, and verify the tokenization.
   - Validate handling of edge cases like empty input code or special characters.

2. **Syntactic Analysis:**
   - Verify that the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is constructed correctly from the tokens generated by the lexical analysis.
   - Test with different combinations of tokens to ensure the correct tree structure is formed.
   - Test for cases where the code is invalid syntactically and ensure appropriate error handling.

3. **Semantic Analysis:**
   - Test with input codes that have semantic errors and ensure that the semantic analyzer detects them accurately.
   - Verify that the semantic analysis results in a list of errors if any, and the errors are meaningful.
   - Validate the handling of valid code without any semantic errors.

4. **Code Generation:**
   - Verify that the generated code matches the expected executable code or intermediate code based on the provided AST.
   - Test with different AST structures and verify the corresponding generated code.
   - Stress test the code generator with large and complex ASTs to check for performance and scalability.

5. **Overall Integration Testing:**
   - Run the main program with sample input codes and validate the complete flow from lexical analysis to code generation.
   - Test the interaction between modules to ensure seamless processing of code through lexical, syntactic, semantic analysis, and code generation.
   - Perform rigorous testing with various combinations of valid and invalid input codes to cover all scenarios.

6. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure the time taken for each module (lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, code generation) individually for large input codes.
   - Analyze the memory consumption of each module during processing and optimize if necessary.
   - Evaluate the overall performance of the parser by running it with large datasets and monitoring resource usage.

7. **Error Handling and Exception Testing:**
   - Introduce intentional errors in the code and verify that the parser handles them gracefully without crashing.
   - Test for scenarios where unexpected exceptions are raised and ensure appropriate error messages are displayed.
   - Validate the error handling mechanism in each module to cover edge cases and unexpected inputs.

8. **Data Discrepancy Testing:**
   - Validate the consistency of data between different stages of processing (lexical, syntactic, semantic analysis, code generation).
   - Ensure that the data structures like tokens, AST, errors, and generated code are correctly passed between modules without any loss or modification.
   - Test for scenarios where data discrepancies may occur and implement checks to maintain data integrity.

9. **Scalability and Replication Testing:**
   - Test the parser's ability to handle a large volume of concurrent requests by simulating multiple instances running in parallel.
   - Verify the parser's behavior under heavy load conditions and assess its scalability by increasing the workload gradually.
   - Implement replication strategies to ensure fault tolerance and high availability of the parser in a distributed environment.

By executing these QA test cases meticulously, we can ensure the robustness, performance, and reliability of the parser developed for lexical, syntactic, semantic analysis, and code generation in Python.
