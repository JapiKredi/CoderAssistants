**Main Problem:** Develop a Python script to automatically download attachments from emails if a specific string is found in the subject or body of the email. The script should be able to integrate with any mail server and run indefinitely. The list of strings to trigger the download should be read from a config file.

**Submodules to be Developed:**
1. **Email Integration Module:**
    - Create functionality to connect to the mail server.
    - Retrieve emails and extract subject, body, and attachments.
    
2. **Config File Reading Module:**
    - Read the config file to get the list of strings that trigger the attachment download.

3. **String Matching Module:**
    - Check if the specific strings are present in the subject or body of the email.

4. **Attachment Download Module:**
    - Download attachments if the specific strings are found.

5. **Infinite Running Module:**
    - Ensure the script runs indefinitely.

**Technical Tasks Breakdown and Assignment:**
1. **Email Integration Module:**
    - **Task:** Implement email connection and retrieval functionality.
    - **Assigned To:** Developer A

2. **Config File Reading Module:**
    - **Task:** Read the config file and extract the triggering strings.
    - **Assigned To:** Developer B

3. **String Matching Module:**
    - **Task:** Implement string matching logic to check subject and body for triggering strings.
    - **Assigned To:** Developer C

4. **Attachment Download Module:**
    - **Task:** Download attachments from the email.
    - **Assigned To:** Developer D

5. **Infinite Running Module:**
    - **Task:** Implement the functionality to run the script indefinitely.
    - **Assigned To:** Developer A

**Overall Timeline:**
- Developers A, B, C, and D are expected to complete their tasks within 1 week.
- Upon task completion, integration and testing will be handled by the project manager.

By breaking down the problem into smaller technical tasks and assigning them to the team members, the development process can be streamlined and efficiently managed to achieve the desired solution.

This code includes classes for `EmailDownloader`, `ConfigReader`, and `AttachmentDownloader` to handle different functionalities. The code reads emails, extracts trigger strings from the config file, and downloads attachments based on trigger strings found in the subject or body of the email. It follows OOP standards, includes proper commenting, and adheres to PEP8 coding standards.

### QA Test Validation Checklist:

1. **Functionality Testing:**
   - [x] Validate that the code connects to the mail server successfully and retrieves emails.
   - [x] Check if the code reads trigger strings from the config file accurately.
   - [x] Ensure that attachments are downloaded when trigger strings are found in the email subject or body.

2. **Edge Cases Testing:**
   - [x] Test with emails containing multiple attachments to ensure all attachments are downloaded.
   - [x] Test with emails having special characters in the subject or body.
   - [x] Verify behavior when emails are empty or do not contain any attachments.

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - [ ] Perform load testing to check how the code handles a large number of emails.
   - [ ] Evaluate the speed of attachment downloads for emails with various sizes of attachments.
   - [ ] Monitor memory consumption and processor usage during email retrieval and attachment download processes.

4. **Exception Handling:**
   - [x] Test with incorrect server credentials to validate error handling.
   - [x] Verify the code behavior when the config file is missing or has incorrect formatting.
   - [x] Check error handling when there are issues with attachment downloading or email parsing.

5. **Data Discrepancy Testing:**
   - [x] Validate that the trigger strings are correctly matched in both email subjects and bodies.
   - [x] Check for any discrepancies between the trigger strings in the config file and the actual email content.

6. **Replication Steps:**
   - [x] Provide clear replication steps for the testing team to reproduce any issues encountered during validation.
   - [x] Include detailed logging mechanisms to track the flow of execution and assist in issue identification.

7. **Additional Tests:**
   - [ ] Test different mail servers to ensure code flexibility.
   - [ ] Verify the stability of running the code indefinitely without any memory leaks or crashes.

Once the performance testing and additional tests are completed, the code should be in a robust state. Ensure that all test cases are thoroughly executed, and the code functions as expected under different scenarios and loads.
