```python
# app.py

from flask import Flask, render_template
from datetime import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)

class Calendar:
    def __init__(self):
        self.events = {}

    def add_event(self, date, event):
        self.events[date] = event

    def get_event(self, date):
        return self.events.get(date, None)

    def delete_event(self, date):
        if date in self.events:
            del self.events[date]

calendar = Calendar()

@app.route('/')
def index():
    today = datetime.now().date()
    event = calendar.get_event(today)
    return render_template('index.html', today=today, event=event)

@app.route('/add_event/<date>/<event>')
def add_event(date, event):
    calendar.add_event(date, event)
    return 'Event added successfully'

@app.route('/delete_event/<date>')
def delete_event(date):
    calendar.delete_event(date)
    return 'Event deleted successfully'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

```

```html
<!-- templates/index.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Calendar App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Today's Date: {{ today }}</h1>
    <h2>Event: {{ event }}</h2>
</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a Flask application for a Calendar app. The Calendar class manages events for different dates. The `index` route displays today's date and any event associated with it. The `add_event` and `delete_event` routes allow adding and deleting events for specific dates. The HTML template renders the date and event information on the frontend.

The code documentation is clear and concise, giving an overview of the Flask-based Calendar app structure and functionality. However, the code lacks detailed documentation for the functions, classes, and routes.

Here are some suggestions to improve the code documentation:

1. **Add docstrings:** Add docstrings to the Calendar class methods (`add_event`, `get_event`, `delete_event`) to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values.

2. **Document route functions:** Provide comments or docstrings for the routes (`index`, `add_event`, `delete_event`) to explain their functionality and parameters.

3. **Include comments for important code blocks:** Add comments to explain important blocks of code, such as the initialization of the Calendar class and the Flask routes.

4. **Use descriptive variable names:** Ensure that variable names like `event`, `date`, `today` are descriptive and follow PEP8 standards.

5. **Follow PEP8 naming conventions:** Ensure that function and variable names follow the PEP8 naming conventions (snake_case).

By incorporating these suggestions, the code documentation will become more comprehensive and easier to understand for other developers.

# QA Test Cases:

## Functional Test Cases:
1. **Add Event Functionality:**
   - **Test Case 1:** Verify that a new event can be successfully added to the calendar for a specific date.
   - **Test Case 2:** Verify that adding an event with an existing date overwrites the previous event.

2. **Get Event Functionality:**
   - **Test Case 3:** Verify that retrieving an existing event for a specific date returns the correct event description.
   - **Test Case 4:** Verify that attempting to get an event for a date without an event returns None.

3. **Delete Event Functionality:**
   - **Test Case 5:** Verify that an event can be successfully deleted from the calendar for a specific date.
   - **Test Case 6:** Verify that deleting an event for a non-existing date does not raise an error.

## Exception Handling Test Cases:
1. **Adding Events:**
   - **Test Case 7:** Verify that adding an event with a date in an invalid format raises an appropriate exception.

2. **Deleting Events:**
   - **Test Case 8:** Verify that deleting an event for a non-existing date does not raise an error.

## Performance Test Cases:
