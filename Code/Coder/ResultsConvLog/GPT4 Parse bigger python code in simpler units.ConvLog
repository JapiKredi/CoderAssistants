Parse bigger python code in simpler units

################

user ---> project_planner

The aim is to simplify a big Python code into smaller, more manageable parts. To do this effectively, we can break down this problem into several submodules: 

1. Codebase Analysis
2. Module Decomposition
3. Code Refactoring
4. Code Documentation and Commenting
5. Debugging & Testing 

Here are the tasks to be delegated to the team members:

1. Codebase Analysis: This involves understanding the work mechanism of the existing Python code. It requires perusal of the code comments, documentation, and perhaps discussing with the original code writers if possible.
   - Delegate to: Team Member A.

2. Module Decomposition: This step includes breaking down the large codebase into separate functional units or sub-modules. A good module decomposition should isolate responsibilities and limit module interaction as much as possible.
   - Delegate to: Team Member B and Team Member C.

3. Code Refactoring: This involves cleaning up the decomposed code segments, optimising certain parts where necessary and working on improving code readability.
   - Delegate to: Team Member D.

4. Code Documentation and Commenting: Each decomposed module should be thoroughly documented and commented. The objective here is to ensure that any team member, or even an outsider, can understand the functionality of the module quickly and easily.
   - Delegate to: Team Member E.

5. Debugging & Testing: Debug the decomposed modules to ensure integrity and functionality. Perform rigorous testing to ensure that separate modules still relate effectively with each other. 
   - Delegate to: Team Member F.

Members B, C, D, E should work closely as they will be working on similar parts of code, and their work is sequential and interdependent in this context. It's crucial for them to have clear communication and regular status update sessions. 

In parallel, Member A can work on studying the codebase, and Member F can plan his testing strategies. When team member D finishes his work, team member F can start his debugging and testing process. This will ensure a smooth transition between tasks and no member will be blocked due to the unavailability of other tasks.

I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but writing a working code for splitting a large Python code into smaller units would not be feasible within this platform. The process of splitting a large Python file into smaller units is heavily dependent on the existing code structure and needs to be done manually by understanding the code logic.  

However, I can provide a simple example on how you can break a python code into class-based modules which follow OOP standards. 

```python
# File Name: shapes.py

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14*self.radius*self.radius


class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length*self.width
```

You can then import this module elsewhere in the code:

```python
# File Name: main.py
from shapes import Circle, Rectangle

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())  # prints: 78.5

rectangle = Rectangle(4, 3)
print(rectangle.area())  # prints: 12
```

This is a very basic example and your actual code could be more complex with more interactions between the classes which needs careful planning.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you need help on any other topics.

As an added approach, I would recommend renaming any variables or functions that are not descriptive or do not comply with PEP8.

PEP8 recommends function and variable names to be in lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability (for instance "compute_average" rather than "ComputeAverage" or "computeaverage").

The aim is to have self-documenting code, i.e., variable and function names are so descriptive that additional comments become unnecessary. However, good code also includes comprehensive documentation and comments for complex logic when necessary.

Here's an example of how to rename functions and variables according to PEP8:

```python
# instead of this
def Calc(a,b):
    Res=a+b
    return Res

# do this
def calculate_sum(first_number, second_number):
    result = first_number + second_number
    return result
```
In the first example, the function name and variables are not descriptive and do not represent what the function is doing. In the second one, both the function and the variables have been renamed in a way that makes the code much more self-explanatory, thereby complying with PEP8 guidelines for code readability.

Remember to revise any class names in your code to ensure they are written in CapWords case according to PEP8 guidelines.

Finally, don't forget to add docstrings to your functions to explain what they do, what the input parameters are, and what they return. This adds to the overall comprehensibility of the code.

```python
def calculate_sum(first_number, second_number):
    """
    Calculates the sum of the two input numbers.
    
    Parameters:
    first_number (int or float): The first number.
    second_number (int or float): The second number.

    Returns:
    result (int or float): The sum of the two numbers.
    """
    result = first_number + second_number
    return result
```
By following PEP8 conventions and ensuring comprehensive code documentation, you not only improve the readability and maintainability of your code but also foster good coding practices among your team.

Here are a few QA test cases that need to be developed:

1. Unit tests for individual functions and methods. This includes tests for normal inputs, edge cases and invalid inputs.

Example:

```python
def test_square():
    assert square(2) == 4
    assert square(-2) == 4
    assert square(0) == 0
    try:
        square('2')
        assert False
    except:
        assert True
```

2. Integration tests that ensure different parts of the code work together correctly. These tests will often involve creating dummy inputs and checking the outputs.

Example:

```python
def test_data_processing():
    raw_data = get_dummy_data()
    processed_data = process_data(raw_data)
    assert processed_data meets certain conditions
```

3. Exception tests that deliberately trigger exceptions to make sure they are being handled correctly.

Example:

```python
def test_divide():
    assert divide(10, 2) == 5
    try:
        divide(10, 0)
        assert False
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        assert True
```

4. Performance tests should be developed to measure the performance of the code and to ensure it meets the requirements. One possible way to implement this is through profiling where the time taken for each function to execute is measured.

Example:

```python
def test_performance():
    start_time = time.time()
    perform_complex_operation()
    end_time = time.time() - start_time
    assert end_time meets_time_limit
```

5. Test cases for replication should be developed to ensure the code functions consistently in different environments or when run multiple times.

Example:

```python
def test_replication():
    result1 = run_function()
    result2 = run_function()
    assert result1 == result2
```

Remember that the goal is not to write tests that pass, but rather to write tests that fail when there's a bug in the code. Tests should aim to cover as much of the code as possible, although 100% coverage rarely happens in practice. Furthermore, each test should be independent of others, meaning the result of one test should not affect the result of another test. A good practice would be to use setup and teardown methods where appropriate. 

Test cases should be written before the code is written. This follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) concept and can lead to higher quality code and less debugging later on. 

 QA developers should make sure to update test cases as the software requirements change, or as more is learned about the system being tested. It's important to regularly maintain these cases to accurately reflect the state of the system.

Great! You have covered major types of tests that can be developed for the code. In addition to these, I would suggest a few more test cases to cover different scenarios:

1. Dependency Tests: If the Python code is dependent on external services or databases, tests should be written to ensure the connections are correctly established and that data is properly sent and received.

2. Data tests: If the code handles a database, tests should be done to verify data manipulation (inserting, updating and deleting data). The integrity and consistency of data should be checked.

3. Regression Testing: This helps find new errors in existing functionality. It’s conducted after a new feature is added or after a bug has been fixed.

4. Load Testing: It checks the performance of the system under heavy loads. 

5. Code review: Apart from the usual testing, having another set of eyes review the code can be invaluable. Code reviews should be carried out to verify that best practices have been followed and to catch any logical errors that might have been overlooked.

This completes a robust testing framework which includes unit testing, integration testing, exception testing, performance testing, replication testing, dependency testing, data testing, regression testing, load testing, and code review. These tests will ensure that the code is reliable, secure, efficient, and performs as expected.

Certainly, here is how you can potentially break down the problem:

1. Problem Understanding and Requirement Gathering (Team Leader)
   - Understand and clearly define the problem.
   - Study the source code.

2. Architecture Design and Planning (Senior Developers)
   - Decompose the architecture into modules such as User Interface, API communication, Data processing, and so forth.

3. Module Development (Software Developers)
   Tasks for software developers can be broken down based on the modules mentioned above:

    3.1 User Interface module
        - Develop User Interface as per the design
        - Generate/populate data dynamically on the interface

    3.2 API communication module
        - Develop API's, if not available, for communication
        - Develop function to fetch the data from the API
        - Develop function to send the data to the API

    3.3 Data processing module
        - Develop function to process the fetched data
        - Develop function to validate the data before sending to API

4. Integration (Senior developers/developers)
   - Integrate all modules and make them work together seamlessly.

5. Testing (QA Engineers)
   - Unit testing of each function
   - Functional testing of each feature
   - Integration testing after integrating all modules 
   - Performance and Load Testing
   - Prepare a report with the results of the tests

6. Debugging and Fixing Issues (Software Developers)
   - Fix bugs and issues reported by QA Engineers
   - Modify the code as per review comments if any

7. Project Documentation (Technical Writers or someone with good documentation skill)
   - Document the architecture and flow of the system
   - Document the code as needed
   - Prepare user manuals or other documentation as necessary

8. User Acceptance Testing and Delivery (QA Engineers)
   - Perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
   - Prepare the software for delivery

The exact team members would depend on what roles are available within the team. The above lists the optimal team structure for the project.

################

user ---> qa_developer

Test Case 1: Exception Handling Test
- Aim: To test if the code has robust exception handling.
- Steps:
    - Cause an exception intentionally in the code (you can do this by providing wrong type of data or breaking the data format).
    - Excute the code.
- Expected Output: The code should throw a custom error message instead of breaking, ensuring that the user can understand what went wrong.

Test Case 2: Data Discrepancy Test
- Aim: To test if the code can handle data discrepancies.
- Steps:
    - Supply the code with data with discrepancies (duplicate entries for a supposed-unique field, missing data, incorrect types).
    - Execute the code.
- Expected Output: The code should either be able to handle discrepancies (ignoring duplicates, supplying defaults for missing data) or throw custom error messages.

Test Case 3: Performance Test
- Aim: To test if the code can execute within a given time frame for large data sets.
- Steps:
    - Supply the code with a large data set.
    - Use a timer to measure how long the code takes to execute this.
- Expected Output: The code should be able to process the data within an acceptable time frame, as specified by your application's requirements.

Test Case 4: Data Replication Test
- Aim: To check if the code replicates data correctly.
- Steps:
    - If your code involves operations like copying databases or cloning objects, perform these operations.
    - Compare the original and the replicated data.
- Expected Output: The original and replicated data should match. 

Test Case 5: Code Robustness Test
- Aim: To test the ability of the code to handle edge cases.
- Steps:
    - Identify potential edge cases that might occur. This could include inputting the largest possible input values, inputting null or empty values, or causing intentional errors in the process.
    - Execute the code with these edge cases.
- Expected Output: The code should demonstrate robustness either by effectively handling these edge cases or by failing gracefully with custom error messages.

Remember, the above test cases might change based on the functionality of the code, the developer should change each test case aims, steps and expected output based on the requirements of the project.

user ---> qa_validator

The QA test cases provided above seem to cover almost all important aspects such as exception handling, data discrepancies, performance, replication, and handling of edge cases. 

To validate the QA tests developed by the QA developer, let's consider a few things:

- Check if each possible flow and function of the code has been covered. This means exception handling tests, data discrepancy tests, performance tests, replication tests, and edge cases must be identified and tested.
- Confirm if the tests run and generate expected outputs. For instance, tests meant for identifying exceptions should be able to do so correctly and reliably.
- Evaluate the test conditions: Are unexpected inputs or data discrepancy causing the code to fail or break? If the code is failing, is it failing elegantly with custom error messages that allow users to understand what went wrong?
- Make sure the tests assess performance and functionality. Under performance tests, the code should be able to handle large data sets within an acceptable time frame.
- Replication tests should verify if the code duplicates data accurately, and edge cases should be well-thought-out and all-encompassing.

Lastly, to manage any case exceptions, data discrepancies, performance fluctuations, and replication issues, it is paramount that robust exception handling methods are in place. Also, it is essential to have a monitoring system that logs failures or exceptions, so there's a clear understanding of where the system fails, in order to resolve such issues for future iterations.

Remember, testing is a continuous activity, which means even after this validation is over, the QA team should continue executing these tests until the code/release goes live. In fact, additional tests might be required post-release as well, to ensure the robustness of the code in the production environment. Any anomalies or test case failures must be documented, communicated to the concerned teams, and fixed at the earliest. 

The end goal should be to maintain the reliability, efficiency, and accuracy of the code, providing a good user experience.

The project involves breaking down a large Python codebase into simplified, smaller units. Following is a breakdown of the problem into different core areas that we can focus our efforts on.

1. **Code Analysis**: This would involve understanding the raw python code, its functions, and how they interconnect. This will help us identify the primary modules or blocks within the code.

Delegate to: Team member A

2. **Module Decomposition**: Here, we would split the bigger code into smaller, logically separated modules or functions based on the analysis. 

Delegate to: Team member B

3. **Code Simplification**: In this task, the code within the modules would be simplified. This can include using simpler logic, improving function definitions, removing redundancy, etc.   

Delegate to: Team member C

4. **Interface Development**: Create interfaces or connectors that allow these newly created modules to interact with each other while maintaining the overall functionality of the original code.

Delegate to: Team member D

5. **Integration Testing**: After decomposing and simplifying the original code, this task would involve testing to ensure that the newly created modules work together as intended.

Delegate to: Quality Assurance team

6. **Documentation**: Documenting the entire process, explaining the functionality of each module, the interfaces, and how to use or modify them.  

Delegate to: Team member E

By delegating tasks this way, we're enabling team members with specialized sets of skills to focus on areas where they can excel, hence ensuring a high quality of work and maintaining efficiency. Each module should be developed in such a way that it can be independently developed, tested, and reused.

I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but providing full python code here would not be possible due to the lack of concrete requirements or problem statement. 

However, I will provide an example of a simple task manager program using OOP design principles. Please note that we are using no external dependencies here, so no specific versions are required.

```python
class Task:
    """
    Represents a Task with a name and status.
    """
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.is_complete = False
    
    def complete(self):
        """
        Set this task as complete.
        """
        self.is_complete = True
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f'Task: {self.name}, Completed: {self.is_complete}'


class TaskList:
    """
    Represents a list of tasks.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.tasks = []
    
    def add_task(self, task):
        """
        Add a task to task list.
        
        Parameters:
        task (Task): Task object
        """
        self.tasks.append(task)
    
    def get_task(self, name):
        """
        Get a task by its name.
        
        Parameters:
        name (str): Name of the task
        """
        for task in self.tasks:
            if task.name == name:
                return task
        return None
                
    def complete_task(self, name):
        """
        Mark a task as complete
        
        Parameters:
        name (str): Name of the task
        """
        task = self.get_task(name)
        if task:
            task.complete()
    
    def print_tasks(self):
        """
        Print all tasks
        """
        for task in self.tasks:
            print(task)


# Usage
my_task_list = TaskList()
my_task_list.add_task(Task('Buy milk'))
my_task_list.add_task(Task('Buy bread'))
my_task_list.print_tasks()
my_task_list.complete_task('Buy milk')
my_task_list.print_tasks()
```

This is a very simple example, in real world situations your classes would be much more complex with detailed logic. In the above code, we create `Task` and `TaskList` classes representing a task and a list of tasks respectively. Each task has a name and a status, and can be marked as complete. The `TaskList` class is capable of adding tasks, marking a task as complete by its name, and printing a list of tasks. 

The main focus while designing these classes is that each class should have a single responsibility, a concept known as Single Responsibility Principle in OOP design.

The example provided by the code writer illustrates a use of object-oriented programming standards for Python, which is great for simpler codes. But let's look at its elements in the context of PEP8, general conventions and practices for readability and clarity.

Looking at the Code Structure and Naming Convention:

1. Class Names: According to PEP8 standards, class names should normally use the CapWords convention. In this code "Task" and "TaskList" are appropriately named. 

2. Function Names: According to PEP8 standards, function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Functions such as "complete", "add_task", "get_task", "complete_task", "print_tasks" are all correctly named according to these standards.

3. Variable Names: The variable names "name", "is_complete" and "tasks" are all lowercase with underscores separating words, which is consistent with PEP8 naming conventions. They are also quite descriptive which helps in understanding what they represent in the code.

Looking at the Code Documentation:

1. Docstrings have been provided for all classes and functions, describing what they do, which makes it easy for anyone reading the code. 

To make the documentation more comprehensive, the type of parameters and a description of the type can be included in the docstrings of the function.

Example: 

```Python
def add_task(self, task):
    """
    Add a task to task list. 
    
    Parameters: 
        task (Task): an instance of the Task class
    """
```

In summary, this example adheres well to Python's PEP8 standards and is written in a clear, readable and descriptive manner. With some minor enhancements, such as detailing argument descriptions in the docstrings, this example would be very comprehensive and extremely well-executed.

Following are the test cases for this project:

1. **Test Case 1: Exceptions**
   - Scenario: Verify how the program deals with invalid inputs or actions leading to exceptions.
   - Steps:
     ```python
     newTask = "not a Task object"    # Not a Task instance
     my_task_list.add_task(newTask)   # Attempt to add
     ```
   - Expected Result: The program should handle this gracefully, either by ignoring or by throwing a relevant custom error message.
   
2. **Test Case 2: Data Discrepancy**
   - Scenario: Verify the program when data with discrepancies (e.g., duplicate entries, empty strings for task names, etc.).
   - Steps: 
     ```python
     duplicateTask = Task('Buy bread')    # Already exists in TaskList
     my_task_list.add_task(duplicateTask) # Attempt to add duplicate
     ```
   - Expected Result: Check how the system handles duplicates. It should prevent duplicate entries or handle them appropriately.

3. **Test Case 3: Performance**
   - Scenario: Check the speed and performance of code execution for large task lists.
   - Steps:
     ```python
     # Add large numbers of tasks and time how long it takes
     ```
   - Expected Result: The code should be able to process data within an acceptable time frame.

4. **Test Case 4: Check Data Replicas**
   - Scenario: Verify if replication correctly duplicates tasks.
   - Steps: 
     ```python
     # Try editing an existing task and check if it does not affect the original
     ```
   - Expected Result: Modified task must be a new object, original task should remain unchanged.

5. **Test Case 5: Test for Robustness**
   - Scenario: Check how the code handles edge cases
   - Steps: 
     ```python
     # Try marking a task as complete that doesn't exist in the task list
     ```
   - Expected Result: The code should handle this situation elegantly by providing a custom error message indicating task does not exist.

6. **Test Case 6: Check Data Integrity**
   - Scenario: Verify if completing a task does not affect the status of other tasks.
   - Steps: 
     ```python
     my_task_list.complete_task('Buy bread')  # Complete the task
     print task other than 'Buy bread'
     ```
   - Expected Result: Only status of task 'Buy bread' should be completed, rest should remain unchanged.

Remember to prepare test environment before running these test cases, and clean up after the tests are done to ensure integrity and independence among different test cases.

The QA test cases proposed by the QA developer are well designed and cover a range of scenarios. However, to further validate them against the task requirements, the following additional factors should also be considered:

1. **Edge Case Coverage**: This was well pointed out by the QA developer. Edge case testing is important as application behavior during edge cases can significantly impact performance and functionality. 

2. **Error Handling**: The handling of exceptions in the application should be scrutinized. A good test suite would not only check for expected exceptions but also trigger unexpected ones to test the robustness of exception handling.

3. **Input Validation**: It is crucial to confirm that all types of inputs, valid or invalid, are managed correctly by the application and do not lead to any unexpected behaviors or results.

4. **Consistency**: When handling tasks like decomposition and simplification of code, it's important to ensure that the output remains consistent, regardless of the changes made to the codebase.

5. **Performance**: Performance testing will help to ensure that the split code executes within an acceptable timeframe when handling data in various quantities.

6. **Replication**: If replication is an aspect of the Python code, it is necessary to ensure that the data replication works as expected and does not introduce discrepancies.

Overall, good QA tests not only ensure that the code works as expected but also challenge the code to handle scenarios it may encounter during practical use. Any anomalies discovered during these tests would not necessarily denote a failure of the code, but rather serve as an opportunity for refinement and improvement. 

Regarding managing the different aspects of testing - such as case exceptions, data discrepancies, performance, and replication - it is crucial to structure test cases in a way that separates these aspects as distinctly as possible. This approach allows for a thorough understanding and detection of bugs and loopholes within the system. It may also be beneficial to write automated tests for these cases to detect issues in early stages.

Finally, another important dimension of testing is analyzing the response of the code to security threats. Though this may not be necessary for all projects, it is still a good practice to conduct security testing, especially when sensitive information is involved. 

On top of these, tools like `unittest` (built into Python), PyTest, and Robot Framework can help with the creation of more advanced test suites if necessary. 

The final step after conducting these QA tests would be to analyze the results, and depending on the severity of the bugs found, either work on fixes and improvements or move on to the deployment process if no critical issues are found.

The large Python code needs to be broken down into different submodules or smaller units for better manageability and easy understanding. The submodules that need to be developed are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Before performing any operations on the data, it's important to preprocess it. This includes handling missing values, outliers detection, data cleaning, data transformation, one-hot encoding for categorical variables, etc.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: This includes data analysis using statistical and mathematical operations, and visualizations like bar graphs, histograms, line plots, etc, to gain insights from the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**: This involves selecting the most important features and preparing your input dataset using the best representation.

4. **Model Development and Training**: Define a model, set up its architecture, and train it using your training dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Evaluate the model performance on the test data, optimize parameters for better accuracy, precision, recall or any selected metrics, use techniques like GridSearch or RandomizedSearch for hyperparameter tuning, etc.

6. **Model Serialization**: Once the models are trained, serialize the models so that they can be saved and loaded for future use without retraining.

7. **Prediction & Deployment**: Deploy the model and predict the outcomes on new/unseen data. It can be either in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc, or local server using Flask or Django.

Here are the smaller technical tasks that can be delegated to the team members:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Team Member A
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Team Member B
3. **Feature Engineering**: Team Member C
4. **Model Development and Training**: Team Member D
5. **Model Evaluation and Optimization**: Team Member E
6. **Model Serialization**: Team Member F
7. **Prediction & Deployment**: Team Member G

Remember, after each task completion, code reviews and testing should be done to ensure quality work. The delegation of the tasks might be changed according to the expertise level and capability of each team member.
