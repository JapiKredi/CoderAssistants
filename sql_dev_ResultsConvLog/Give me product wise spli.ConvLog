Sure! To retrieve the product-wise split for each territory, we can use a query that joins the relevant tables containing information on products, territories, and sales data. Here's an example query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT t.territory_name, p.product_name, SUM(s.quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales_data s
JOIN territories t ON s.territory_id = t.territory_id
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY t.territory_name, p.product_name;
```

This query will provide you with the product-wise split for each territory by summing up the quantities sold for each product in each territory.
