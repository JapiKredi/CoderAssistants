Sure! Here's the SQL query to retrieve all the people who work out of New York State using the AdventureWorks dataset:

```sql
SELECT p.FirstName, p.LastName
FROM Person.Person AS p
JOIN HumanResources.Employee AS e ON p.BusinessEntityID = e.BusinessEntityID
JOIN Person.Address AS a ON e.AddressID = a.AddressID
JOIN Person.StateProvince AS sp ON a.StateProvinceID = sp.StateProvinceID
WHERE sp.Name = 'New York'
```

This query retrieves the first name and last name of people who work out of New York State by joining the necessary tables and filtering the results based on the state name.

Let me know if you need any further assistance or modifications to the query!

JOIN Person.Address AS a ON e.AddressID = a.AddressID
