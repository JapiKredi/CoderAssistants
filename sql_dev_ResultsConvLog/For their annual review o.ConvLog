For their annual review of the company pricing strategy, the Product Team wants to look at the products that are currently being offered for a specific price range ($20 to $50). In order to help them they asked you to provide them with a list of products with the following information:

their name
their unit price
Filtered on the following conditions:

their unit price is between 20 and 50
they are not discontinued
Finally order the results by unit price in a descending order (highest first).

To generate the list of products meeting the specified conditions, we need to break down the task into smaller requests for the Senior Analyst and Junior Analyst to work on developing SQL queries. The requests are as follows:

For the Senior Analyst:
1. Retrieve the necessary information about products such as product name, unit price, and discontinuation status.
2. Filter the products where the unit price is between $20 and $50.
3. Filter out the discontinued products.

For the Junior Analyst:
4. Join the necessary tables to access the product information.
5. Implement the filters based on the unit price range and discontinuation status.
6. Order the results by unit price in descending order.

Once the queries are developed, we can combine the results to provide the Product Team with the list of products meeting their requirements.

Let's proceed with retrieving and analyzing the data to generate the required list of products.

Let's start with the queries that the Junior Analyst can work on:

Junior Analyst's Tasks:
1. Join the necessary tables to access the product information.
2. Implement the filters based on the unit price range and discontinuation status.
3. Order the results by unit price in descending order.

Given these tasks, I will provide you with the initial SQL query to accomplish the first part - joining the necessary tables to access the product information:

```sql
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    p.unit_price
FROM
    products p
JOIN
    product_details pd ON p.product_id = pd.product_id
WHERE
    p.unit_price BETWEEN 20 AND 50
    AND pd.discontinued = 'no'
ORDER BY
    p.unit_price DESC;
```

You can utilize this query as the foundation and continue working on implementing the filters and ordering the results. Let me know if you need any further assistance or have any questions.

Thank you for the initial SQL query. I will use it as the base and continue with implementing the filters on the unit price range and discontinuation status, as well as sorting the results by unit price in descending order. I will provide you with the completed query once finished. Let me work on this.
